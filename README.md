# DebugedJDK
A Powerful Java ByteCode Processor
## Simplify your code logic
DebugedJDK is good at handling common logic obfuscation, and you can use it to recover the part of your program that was obfuscated by the evil obfuscator after it has been slowed down by the obfuscator.According to statistics, a large amount of Java program performance is cut by obfuscators, and this project is designed to save your own project from low-performance code tainted by obfuscators
## Edit byte code in real time
DebugedJDK can scan class files from memory, regardless of when they are loaded.This helps you learn how the JVM handles bytecode in real time, and we provide the most secure means of scanning to ensure that the target program is not aware of it
## Decompilation tool
